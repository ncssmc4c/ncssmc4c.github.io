<h2>We want to help you help people.</h2><br>
<h3><b>First impressions count</b></h3>
<p>In the digital age, your online presence is everything. In fact, it takes on average just 0.05 seconds for
    visitors/users to form an opinion about your website and determine if they’re going to stay. Let’s maximize those
    crucial moments to share your ideas with the world.</p>
<h3><b>Completely Free</b></h3>
<p>We believe it should not take hundreds of dollars to make a quality website. Motivated to best serve our community,
    all of our services are completely free.</p>
<h3><b>Tailored to you</b></h3>
<p>We will provide individualized support for your charity, whether it’s a unique tool, fun theme, or even a mobile
    app. We will not only showcase necessary information, but help you tell your story. This means clean and
    aesthetic designs, navigable pages, and interactive features.</p>
<h3><b>Experienced developers</b></h3>
<p>We may be high school students, but we have abundant experience in web development and programming in general. But
    above all, we care. We are ready to dedicate time to apply what we’ve learned to create an amazing website for
    your charity.</p>
